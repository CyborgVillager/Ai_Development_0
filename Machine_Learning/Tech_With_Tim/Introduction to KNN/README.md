# Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors

 This folder will be a mla program to gather/classify data. This machine
 learning algorithm will be classifing the data into each of its own
 categories that it will fit.
 
 Example: if the data is a dog it will be classified as a canine, cat ->
 feline, tortiose -> reptile, etc.
 
 For this folder it will be classifying cars in four categories depending on
 the car features.
