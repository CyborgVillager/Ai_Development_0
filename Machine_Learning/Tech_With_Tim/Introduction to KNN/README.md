# Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors

 This folder will be a mla program to gather/classify data. This machine
 learning algorithm will be classifing the data into each of its own
 categories that it will fit.
 
 Example: if the data is a dog it will be classified as a canine, cat ->
 feline, tortiose -> reptile, etc.
 
 For this folder it will be classifying cars in four categories depending on
 the car features.
 
 # Basic Info  Regarding the Data Set
- Thanks to **UCI Machine Learning Repository** for supplying the data to assist in the
    development of increasing the world's knowledge on Machine Learning

**Data Set Information:**

>Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX, M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:

>CAR car acceptability
. PRICE overall price
. . buying buying price
. . maint price of the maintenance
. TECH technical characteristics
. . COMFORT comfort
. . . doors number of doors
. . . persons capacity in terms of persons to carry
. . . lug_boot the size of luggage boot
. . safety estimated safety of the car


>**Attribute Information:**
