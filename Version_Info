v0 Intro to Ai Dev Everything has it's Beginning: Will be completing a video from Tech With Tim in learning the
                                                    different areas of Machine learning/Ai
                                                    His Desc:
                                                    Ready to explore machine learning and artificial intelligence in python?
                                                    This python machine learning and AI mega course contains 4 different
                                                    series designed to teach you the ins and outs of ML and AI.
                                                    It talks about fundamental ML algorithms, neural networks, creating
                                                    AI chat bots and finally developing an AI that can play the game of Flappy Bird.

v1 Rebooted: Rebooted orig files, starting from scratch and build up from there.

v2 Installed: Installed tensorflow & Keras
                v2.5 Edit: Paused will resume @ 1/28/2020

v3 Pip install: installed sklearn, panda, & numpy, made a folder to hold .csv files. test.py now prints out the
                    csv files. Will work on making the program predict on 1/29/20
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v4 Beta version .5 Prediction Implemented: The program will now train it self 4 90% & do test 4 10%
                                Line 22 @ test.py takes all of the attributes from Features & Labels ->
                                the program will split them up into 4 arrays  x_train -> section of numpy.array
                                (data.drop([predictiction],1)) , y_train -> numpy.array(data[predictiction])
                                 x_test & y_test will test the accuracy of the program/model.

                                 Imported import sklearn to session1_source/tim_lesson_source.py
                                 Program has basic prediction, of the excel file student-mat.csv, will upgrade further

v5 Prediction Assembled .8: Program test.py can now predict student's grade within a margin,
                                further work is needed to improve accuracy, will test the array from the models that
                                 were not trained on and see the results from there.

                                 Updated ReadMe.md, learned a bit more about ReadMe.txt posting for version control
                                 will be using # to make a title -> # Ai_Development_0
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v6 matplotlip Installed:  open / create a file called studentmodels and save it by using pickle.dump in the directory
                              link for pickle https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html
                                Side note for future reference pickle is not secure, so for future
                                files make sure its clean

v7 Process Increase: Commented out line 26-40 @  file test.py, now it  loads/open & start @
                    pickle_in = open('studentmodels.pickle', 'rb')  the program skips the training process and heads
                    straight to getting the data & saving it aka processing the data is faster

v8  Re-Training Model for the students Modified: line 22-42 has been commented out for re-training the program,
                                                    moved x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test =
                                                    sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split(X, Y, test_size = 0.1)
                                                    to line 19.

v9 Graph Now Shows Data: Line 73 - 85 now will aquire the information and displays it onto a graph for
                            visual data gathering, and helps finding correlation between various subjects
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- -----------------------------
v10 Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors: New folder called Introduction to KNN has been made.
                                            Basic info from the readme that has been created:
                                            This folder will be a mla program to gather/classify data. This machine
                                             learning algorithm will be classifing the data into each of its own
                                             categories that it will fit.

                                             Example: if the data is a dog it will be classified as a canine, cat ->
                                             feline, tortiose -> reptile, etc.

                                             For this folder it will be classifying cars in four categories depending on
                                             the car features.

                                             Source folder has been created called knn source to be used on .py file
                                             knn_tutorial. The car data has been imported to car_data_set for this
                                             experiment

v11 README Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors Updated: Updated the information to Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors
                                                            to assist in knowing a bit more about the application

--v12 Printed Out-Statement: knn_tutorial is now able to print the results from car_data_set/car.data
