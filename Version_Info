v0 Intro to Ai Dev Everything has it's Beginning: Will be completing a video from Tech With Tim in learning the
                                                    different areas of Machine learning/Ai
                                                    His Desc:
                                                    Ready to explore machine learning and artificial intelligence in python?
                                                    This python machine learning and AI mega course contains 4 different
                                                    series designed to teach you the ins and outs of ML and AI.
                                                    It talks about fundamental ML algorithms, neural networks, creating
                                                    AI chat bots and finally developing an AI that can play the game of Flappy Bird.

v1 Rebooted: Rebooted orig files, starting from scratch and build up from there.
v2 Installed: Installed tensorflow & Keras
                v2.5 Edit: Paused will resume @ 1/28/2020
v3 Pip install: installed sklearn, panda, & numpy, made a folder to hold .csv files. test.py now prints out the
                    csv files. Will work on making the program predict on 1/29/20

v4 Beta version .5 Prediction Implemented: The program will now train it self 4 90% & do test 4 10%
                                Line 22 @ test.py takes all of the attributes from Features & Labels ->
                                the program will split them up into 4 arrays  x_train -> section of numpy.array
                                (data.drop([predictiction],1)) , y_train -> numpy.array(data[predictiction])
                                 x_test & y_test will test the accuracy of the program/model.

                                 Imported import sklearn to session1_source/tim_lesson_source.py
                                 Program has basic prediction, of the excel file student-mat.csv, will upgrade further

v5 Prediction Assembled .8: Program test.py can now predict student's grade within a margin,
                                further work is needed to improve accuracy, will test the array from the models that
                                 were not trained on and see the results from there.

                                 Updated ReadMe.md, learned a bit more about ReadMe.txt posting for version control
                                 will be using # to make a title -> # Ai_Development_0

--v6 matplotlip Installed:  open / create a file called studentmodels and save it by using pickle.dump in the directory
                              link for pickle https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html
                                Side note for future reference pickle is not secure, so for future
                                files make sure its clean
