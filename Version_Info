v0 Intro to Ai Dev Everything has it's Beginning: Will be completing a video from Tech With Tim in learning the
                                                    different areas of Machine learning/Ai
                                                    His Desc:
                                                    Ready to explore machine learning and artificial intelligence in python?
                                                    This python machine learning and AI mega course contains 4 different
                                                    series designed to teach you the ins and outs of ML and AI.
                                                    It talks about fundamental ML algorithms, neural networks, creating
                                                    AI chat bots and finally developing an AI that can play the game of Flappy Bird.

v1 Rebooted: Rebooted orig files, starting from scratch and build up from there.
v2 Installed: Installed tensorflow & Keras
                v2.5 Edit: Paused will resume @ 1/28/2020
--v3 Pip install: installed sklearn, panda, & numpy, made a folder to hold .csv files. test.py now prints out the
                    csv files. Will work on making the program predict on 1/29/20
